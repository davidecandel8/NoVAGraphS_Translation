You have a state table (ST) in HTML representing the transitions of a finite state automaton.

ST = """
<table> 
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> <th>
            <th>0<th>
            <th>1<th>
        <tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> * -> q0 <th>
            <th> <th>
            <th> q2 <th>
        <tr>
        <tr>
            <th> q1 <th>
            <th> q0 <th>
            <th> <th>
        <tr>
        <tr>
            <th> q2 <th>
            <th> <th>
            <th> q1 <th>
        <tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
"""
Alphabet = {0,1}
Accepted Language = (110)* 
The automaton can be drawn as a triangle.

How to read the ST: 
-> indicates an initial state; 
* indicates a final state. 

Note that these symbols in a cell mark the state that follows as initial and/or final, they are not state names.

The ST contains a header (between <thead>...</thead>). The header contains a first empty cell, followed by as many cells as there are characters in the alphabet, one cell per character. In the body (between <tbody>...</tbody>), there are as many rows as the number of states in the automaton. The first column represents a specific state. In the following columns, you can either find empty cells, indicating no corresponding transition, or cells with state names, representing transitions to those states using the character in the corresponding column.

Based on the ST provided between """, can you tell me if there is a transition from q0 to q1?
Please answer yes or no followed by a motivation.
