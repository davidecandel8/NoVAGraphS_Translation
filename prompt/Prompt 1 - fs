You have a state table (ST) in HTML representing the transitions of a finite state automaton.
ST = """<table> 
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th>0</th>
            <th>1</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> * -> q0 </th>
            <th> </th>
            <th> q2 </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> q1 </th>
            <th> q0 </th>
            <th> </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> q2 </th>
            <th> </th>
            <th> q1 </th>

Alphabet = {0,1}
Accepted Language = (110)* 
The automaton can be drawn as a triangle.
How to read the ST: 
-> indicates an initial state; 
* indicates a final state. 
Note that these symbols in a cell mark the state that follows as initial and/or final, they are not state names.
The ST contains a header (between <thead>...</thead>). The header contains a first empty cell, followed by as many cells as there are characters in the alphabet, one cell per character. In the body (between <tbody>...</tbody>), there are as many rows as the number of states in the automaton. The first column represents a specific state. In the following columns, you can either find empty cells, indicating no corresponding transition, or cells with state names, representing transitions to those states using the character in the corresponding column.

Here below, you can find 10 examples from which to learn:
Example 1:
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th>0</th>
            <th>1</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> * -> q0 </th>
            <th> </th>
            <th> q0 </th>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
The ST in example 1 indicates that q0 is both initial and final state. From q0 there is no transition with input 0 (empty cell in the middle column), and a transition to q0 with input 1 (because cell contains q0, in the last column). The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is no, as no cell in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".
Example 2:
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th>0</th>
            <th>1</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> * -> q0 </th>
            <th> q0 </th>
            <th> </th>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
The ST in example 2 indicates that q0 is both initial and accepting state. From q0 there is a transition to q0 with 0 as input (cell contains q0, in the middle column), and no transition with input 1 (empty cell in the last column). The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is no, as no cell in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".
Example 3:
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th>0</th>

        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> -> q0 </th>
            <th> q1 </th>
            <th> </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> * q1</th>
            <th> q0 </th>
            <th> </th>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
The ST in example 3 indicates that q0 is the initial state and q1 is the final state. From the initial state q0 there is a transition to q1 with 0 as input (cell contains q0, in the middle column), and no transition with input 1 (empty cell in the last column). From q1 there is a transition to q1 with 0 as input, and no transition with 1 as input. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is yes, as the cell corresponding to input 0 in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".
Example 4:

From the initial state q1 there is a transition to q0 with 0 as input (cell contains q0, in the middle column), and no transition with input 1 (empty cell in the last column). From q0 there is a transition to q1 with 0 as input, and no transition with 1 as input. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is yes, as the cell corresponding to input 0 in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".

From the initial state q1 there is a transition to q0 with 0 as input (cell contains q0, in the middle column), and no transition with input 1 (empty cell in the last column). From q0 there is one transition to itself with 1 as input, and no transition with 1 as input. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is no, as no cell in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".

From the initial state q1 there is a transition to q0 with 0 as input (cell contains q0, in the middle column), and a transition to q1 with input 1 (q1 in the last column). From q0 there is no transition with 0 sa input, and a transition to q1 with 1 as input. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is yes, as the cell corresponding to input 1 in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".

The ST in example 9 indicates that q0 is the initial state and q1 is the final state. From the initial state q0 there are two transitions, one to q2 and one to q1, with 0 as input, and a transition to q0 if the input is 1. From q1 there is a transition to q1 with 0 as input, and a transition to q2 with input 1. Finally, from q2 there is one transition to q1 with input 0, and two transitions, one to q0 and one to q2, with 1 as input. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is yes, as the cell corresponding to input 0 in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains also the string "q1".

    </table>
The ST in example 10 indicates that q0 is both the initial and final state. From the initial state q0 there is one trasition to q3 with 0 as input, and no transition with 1 or 2 as input. Then, from q1 there is a transition to q0 marked by 0, no transition marked by 1, and a transition to q3 marked by 2. From q2 there is no transition with input 0 and 2, and one transition to q3 with input 1. Finally, from q3 there is no transition with input 0 and a transition to q2 with input 1 and a transition to q1 marked by 2. The answer to the question "is there a transition from q0 to q1?" is no, as no cell in the row containing all the transition from q0 contains the string "q1".

Based on the ST provided between """, is there a transition from q0 to q1?
