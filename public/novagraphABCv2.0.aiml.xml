          A particularly important class of automata is that of automata capable of recognizing
          whether or not a string is part of a given language or not: recognizer automata.
          Such a finite-state automaton consists of a finite set of states and a finite set of
          transitions from one state to another. For each distinct pair formed by a state of the
          automaton (the departure state) and an alphabet symbol, there is a transition to an
