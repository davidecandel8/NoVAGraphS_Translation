66fef763aa9a9ff3615fab65,8,what is an automaton,"A finite-state automaton is a dynamic, discrete, invariant system          in which the sets of input, output and state are finite.          The system can be in any of a finite number of internal states that define the automaton.          A particularly important class of automata is that of automata capable of recognizing          whether or not a string is part of a given language or not: recognizer automata.          Such a finite-state automaton consists of a finite set of states and a finite set of          transitions from one state to another. For each distinct pair formed by a state of the          automaton (the departure state) and an alphabet symbol, there is a transition to an          arrival state. The symbol of the pair is said to be associated with the transition, or          even that the transition ""accepts the symbol."" The state of arrival state can also          coincide with the start state. Each finite-state automaton is uniquely associated with an          oriented graph called a transition diagram. The nodes of the graph coincide with the          states of the automaton. If there is a transition from state q to state p with a as the          associated symbol, then there is an arc oriented from node q to node p and labeled with          the symbol a.
